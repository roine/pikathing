Moving away from React
== 

I've been working on this project since October 2018, in 2 days I've achieve 5 times more in Elm than 3 months with React.

The reason is simple in Elm I can focus on the implementation much more.


Run the App
==
For development:
`yarn start`

To build production:
`yarn build`


Remaining work
==
- Edit a todolist
- Comparison of todolists
- Improve animation with elm animation rather than css
