Moving away from React
== 

I've been working on this project since October 2018, in 2 days I've achieve 5 times more in Elm than 3 months with React.

The reason is simple in Elm I can focus on the implementation much more.


Run the App
==
For development:
`yarn start`

For production
`NODE_ENV=production yarn start`

Remaining work
==
- Edit the templates, todolist and todo ones. When changing a todolist template by adding todos to it, if a 
todolist uses this template uses it, the number of todos assign should change accordingly
- Edit a todolist
- Comparison of todolists
